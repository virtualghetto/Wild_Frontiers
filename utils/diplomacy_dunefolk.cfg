                {ALLY_SAYS _"It’s alright, councillor, for it’s not far from the truth. I will reveal to you a guarded secret of our people, shared only to our most trusted allies: Centuries ago, when the titans still roamed what is now the Wastes, when pyramids that reach the sky and bountiful rivers were more than drunken tales around campfire… The land of the Wastes was green and fertile, a haven shared by humans and elves alike."}
                {ALLY_SAYS _"However, a dark power was right on the horizon. It poisoned the soil, woke the dead from slumber and turned the green haven into a deathland. It was not long before the elves fled, knowing that their fate is tied to that of the forest’s."}
                {ALLY_SAYS _"And yet, not all hope was lost. A few elves chose to fight alongside the human survivors, refusing to abandon their homeland to the undead horde. It was through bravery, preservation and sacrifice that allowed the survivors to push back the darkness. And it was by ancient faerie art that the remaining elves managed to bring back some life to the wasteland."}
                {ALLY_SAYS _"My people had been distrustful of magic ever since. It was magic which doomed us, but also magic that saved us… For that reason, the survivors parted ways. My ancestors wandered the wastes to scavenge what was left while the elven folks retreated into a secret sanctuary amidst the sand - a location long lost to our people."}
                {ALLY_SAYS _"Time passed, and my people thrived thanks to the same preservation that held us together. Unfortunately, what little plants and water in the wastes are now dying in droves, once again signifying a bad omen. Our governors have long sent out many expeditions to elven forests in the north and ask for their help, yet it would seem that the elves no longer remember their old ally, even driving us away with swords and arrows..."}
                {ALLY_SAYS _"Nevertheless, we still need their assistance if we are to save the desert. I know that I am asking much of you, but please help us bring some the elven mystics to the Wastes."}
                {HERO_SAYS _"What do you think about his tale?"}
                {CYNIC_SAYS _"Personally? It could either be a heroic struggle of a people or an excuse made up by the ones in charge. Nobles infatuated with elven beauty are not unheard of, and having a “reasonable excuse” could let those at the Wastes get away with a lot of shady business."}
                {ADVISOR_SAYS _"If we were to accept this request, it would cement our friendship with The Sons. Yet, there is no other way but to capture some elves..."}
