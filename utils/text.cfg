#define BUILD_KEEP_4
    {NARRATOR_SAYS _"Having found a large field for the center of your new town, you pitch your tent and begin erecting defenses to keep out the denizens of the forests. The peasants who have made the long journey with you quickly sit down under the canvas shelter, grateful for the brief rest."}
    {DELFADOR_SAYS _"Now that you have a keep, recruit Peasant Workers to help you both defend and build your town infrastructure."}
