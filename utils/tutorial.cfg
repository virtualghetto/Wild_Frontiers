Once winter arrives your villages will not produce any income (as there are no crops to harvest), although they will still provide upkeep for your units. You will need to ensure you have enough gold to pay your soldiers throughout the long, cold winter."}
    {TUTORIAL begin_autumn3 _"Since soldiers fight poorly in the snow, try to build up encampments on the borders of your town.

Also in keeping an eye on the upcoming winter, you may want to consider building bridges and roads between any widely separated sections of town. These will increase your mobility once the rivers freeze and snow blankets the ground."}
